# Visualizing_filters_of_a_CNN.
Used a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model to visualize various filters from different layers of the CNN. I have used gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.
I have used TensorFlow as machine learning framework.
